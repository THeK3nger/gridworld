GridWorld
=========

An 3D enviroment for testing AIs powered by [Unity3D][1].

Requisites
----------

This software is built on the free version of Unity3D 3.5.7. You have to use 
this version in order to run and edit it.

All the (free) plugins are included in the repository.

Linux Support
-------------

Also if this software is built on the 3.x version of Unity, it can be loaded 
with Unity 4 in order to use the Linux exporter. 

I'm trying to use a portable syntax avoiding all the deprecated functions. If
you find some problems in running GridWorld on Unity 4, plese, let me know.

Developer Notes
---------------

During the development of this software I'm using [this branching method][2].
